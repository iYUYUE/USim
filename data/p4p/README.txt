[Overview] 


P4P, MSRP-A, and WRPA-authorship-A are paraphrase corpora manually annotated with the paraphrase phenomena they contain.

P4P stands for "Paraphrase for Plagiarism". It consists of a partition of the plagiarism cases in the PAN-PC-10 corpus [3], in concrete, it is composed
of 856 source-plagiarism pairs in English. For further reading on the corpus, refer to [1] and [4].   

MSRP-A stands for "Microsoft Research Paraphrase-Annotated". It consists of the positive cases in the MSRP corpus [2], in concrete, it is composed of
3,900 paraphrase pairs in English.  For further reading on the corpus, refer to [4].  

WRPA-authorship-A contains a subset of the authorship paraphrases in the "Wikipedia-based Relational Paraphrase Acquisition" corpus [5], in concrete, it
is composed of 1,000 pairs in Spanish.  For further reading on the corpus, refer to [4].

[Format]


In order to set out the corpus format, we use the following example:

The format of the corpus is xml.

The "corpus" tag (from lines [2] to [32]) contains the whole corpus and the associated information. In concrete, its attributes specify the name of the
corpus, the version, the language ("lng"), and the location of the xsd schema file (http://clic.ub.edu/mbertran/formats/paraphrase-corpus.xsd). 
Moreover, it contains the "snippets" tag and a set of "paraphrase_candidates" tags. 

The "snippets" tag (from [3] to [7]) contains the set of snippets that will be part of paraphrase candidates. Each "snippet" (from [4] to [6]) contains
the actual text [5] and has two attributes: an id and a "source_description". The latter, which also appears in other tags, is used in the mapping to 
other corpora and databases.   

Each "paraphrase_candidates" tag (from [8] to [31]) contains a pair of snippets ([9] and [10]), which constitute a potential paraphrase pair and are 
linked to the above mentioned snippets by the id. The "paraphrase_candidates" tag also contains the annotation results ("annotation" from [11] to [30]).
The "annotation" tag has the following attributes: "author" (of the annotation) and "is_paraphrase", indicating whether the pair constitutes an actual 
paraphrase (with "true" or "false" values). The "annotation" tag, in turn, contains a set of "phenomenon" tags.

Each "phenomenon" tag (from [12] to [19], and from [20] to [29]) contains an annotated paraphrase phenomenon. It has the "type" attribute (see Tagset below) 
and contains the pair of snippets involved (e.g., "snippet" from [13] to [15] and [16] to [18])]. Each snippet has a set of scopes (e.g. "scope" in [14]), 
one for each continuous chunk covered. "Scope" has two attributes indicating its offset and length at character level. "Addition_deletion" (see Tagset) only 
contains a "scope" tag corresponding to one of the snippets.  

Tags corresponding to morphology-, lexicon-, and semantics-based changes, as well as miscellaneous changes (see Tagset), such as the examples in [12-19], 
also include the "projection" attribute (required). It stands for the impact of the phenomenon in the rest of the snippet. "Projection" values may be 
"global", meaning there is an impact, or "local", meaning there is not. Syntax- and discourse-based change tags, such as the example in [20-29], generally 
include "key" tags (non-required), which contain the most relevant chunks in "scope". There is one "key" for each continuous chunk involved. In 
paraphrase-extreme tags, neither the "projection" attribute nor "key" tags are provided. In the WRPA-authorship-A corpus, "projection" and "key" are not 
included for any tag.

When "is_paraphrase" has the "false" value, a "phenomenon" tag of the type "non-paraphrases" and a "scope" covering the snippets as a whole appears. In 
the case of WRPA-authorship-A, the extremes of the snippet, fulfilled by variables, are not included within this tag.


[Tagset]


The tagset is presented in the following table. Tags are grouped into classes and its extended name or meaning is also provided. When a tag is only 
pertinent to certain corpora, these corpora are specified between parenthesis.

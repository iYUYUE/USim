The name of the Manager of the Haymarket has frequently been the subject of a quip , if not a crank ; still it may yet serve as a peg for slyly observing that , `` At the fall of the Curtain , TREE , naturally enough , appeared with a bough ! ''
I hope , my dear ' -- turning to Bab , who sat silent and petrified -- 'your beautiful gold repeater set with brilliants is safe , and that it did not require repairs or alterations , to induce you to part with it into Mr Newton 's hands ?
In short , he seemed flat and insipid to Bab , who had been compared to the beautiful Lady Mary Manvers by the soft and persuasive tongue of Lady Mary Manvers 's dear friend . Yet , in her secret heart of hearts , Bab drew comparisons by no means disadvantageous to Edward Leslie .

Endowments and buildings are only the means ; unless the end to which these means are subservient be clearly perceived and persistently followed , the means themselves may prove a hindrance rather than a help . Of this Oxford is a notable proof .

In the scenes with Iago he equaled Salvini , yet did not in any one point surpass him . Nor did he in any way imitate him . The fury of the two Othellos is widely different . Salvini is the fiercer , for Rossi 's rage has a background of intensest suffering .
I forgot to mention she added a very minute piece of mace , not enough to make its flavour distinguishable ; and that the coffee-pot must be of tin , and uncovered , or it can not form a thick cream on the surface , which it ought to do .
The separate titles bear date 1729 ; and the publisher was Samuel Birt , at the Bible and Ball , Ave Maria Lane . This notice may supply the information of which Mr. Denton is in quest , and at all events I should be very glad to learn who the author really was .
As yet , everything looked fair with Mr. Bonflon . His face was as honest as the morning sun , and it was next to impossible to doubt him . He might be the prey of some strange phantasm , some monomania ; but the evidences did not show it .
The 'Memoirs ' of the ( now ) Bishop of Lincoln , within its own limits , was a great gift ; but it is avowedly not a 'Life , ' and the world wants a Life . Collation of the originals of these letters has restored sentences and words and things of the most characteristic kind .
I will therefore examine what you have advanced , from a hope of being able to do away any impression left on the minds of such as may be liable to confound with argument a strong prepossession for your Lordship 's talents , experience , and virtues .

We should distinguish , however , the two distinct demands in the case . One is for comprehension ; we look for the theory of a human function which must cover all possible cases of its exercise , whether noble or base . This the Platonists utterly fail to give us .
Taste , when it is spontaneous , always begins with the senses . Children and savages , as we are so often told , delight in bright and variegated colours ; the simplest people appreciate the neatness of muslin curtains , shining varnish , and burnished pots .

To the American politician or business man , that a thing is right or wrong , legal or illegal , seems a pale and irrelevant consideration . The real question is , will it pay ? will it please Theophilus P. Polk or vex Harriman Q. Kunz ?

Dear as war may be , a dishonorable peace will prove much dearer . Great as may be the sufferings of the camp and the battle-field , yet the prolonged tortures of a murdered Union , a violated Constitution , and Secession rampant over the country , will be found to be greater .
Like the whistling-buoy , the bell-buoy sounds the loudest when the sea is the roughest , but the bell-buoy is adapted to shoal water , where the whistling-buoy could not ride ; and , if there is any motion to the sea , the bell-buoy will make some sound .
Were it not so , infinite time past would have exhausted all the matter in the universe , but Nature is clearly immortal . Moreover , there is a correspondence between the structure of bodies and the forces necessary to their destruction .

A poem may argue ; a hymn must not . In short to be a hymn , what is written must express spiritual feelings and desires . The music of faith , hope and charity will be somewhere in its strain . Philosophy composes poems , but not hymns .
She 's a bad girl . We calls 'er GAZEY , 'cos it 's short for GEHAZI ; but that ai n't 'er real nime . She 's a liar . She 's allus tellin ' lies -- seems as if she could n't storp doin ' it . '' JULIA SANBY sighed sadly . `` What kind of lies ? ''

First , therefore , one may deal with raising the craft into the air , and causing it to descend . In the photograph of the school machine shown facing this page , it will be seen that the control surfaces are indicated by lettering .
Pasta 's the name of a singer , then ! Oh , that accounts , for a moment after she the mamma said , that her daughter Arabella sang delightfully , and asked me if I would sing with her ; so I said no , I 'd much rather listen . That was right , war n't it ?
Pasta is a singer 's name , you could not be expected to know that ; but I hope you did n't say any thing to show them your ignorance ? '' `` Oh , no ; you told me , whenever I was completely puzzled , that silence was best ; so I said nothing .

If the Cluyme household was not polite , it was nothing . Eliphalet sat next to Miss Belle , and heard the private history of many old families , which he cherished for future use . Mrs. Cluyme apologized for the dinner , which ( if the truth were told ) needed an apology .
He did not wait for any pressing , but immediately pressed forwards , and as I favoured the insertion as much as I could , a very few thrusts sufficed to lodge the charming intruder fairly within me , evidently as much to his delight as it was to mine .
She said , however , that she was afraid to make any such proposal to her mother for fear of exciting suspicions as to her object , or of occasioning my removal to another room , which would be equally destructive for our projects .

One word more , ere I end this preface . A distinction is sometimes made between Dewey , Schiller and myself , as if I , in supposing the object 's existence , made a concession to popular prejudice which they , as more radical pragmatists , refuse to make .

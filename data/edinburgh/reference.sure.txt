there I found Conseil , who wanted to know the upshot of my interview with the captain .
'' yes , Captain , although since I ve been aboard your vessel , I should have formed the habit of not being amazed by anything ! ''
'' me , I am out like a light ! '' Ned Land replied .
'' no , my friend . what s Ned Land up to ? ''
'' they are southern right whales '' , he said . '' there goes the fortune of a whole whaling fleet '' .
'' and with my own ! '' the harpooner replied simply .
'' in Saint - Malo '' , Conseil returned unflappably .
'' no '' , I said , '' the animal s wounded , there s its blood ; but your weapon did not stick in its body '' .
'' you may talk freely '' , the captain told me . '' this man does not understand French '' .
'' gracious '' , Conseil put in , '' a choir of bulls ? ''
I took a last look at the battleship , which was putting on steam . then I rejoined Ned and Conseil .
Conseil was in ecstasy . carried away by his violent instincts , Ned Land leaped up the companionway . but as soon as his hands seized the railing , he was thrown backward in his turn .
'' see ! '' the harpooner exclaimed . '' there s nothing to see , nothing we ll ever see from this sheetiron prison ! we are simply running around blindfolded -- ''
'' that suits me , Captain '' .
'' like a log , Professor . but I must be imagining things , because it seems like I am breathing a sea breeze ! ''
'' yes , Captain Nemo '' , I replied , '' and the Nautilus is wonderfully suited to this whole survey . ah , it s a clever boat ! ''
'' well , we ve got to accept ! '' the Canadian answered '' . once we are on solid ground , we ll figure out a course of action . besides , it would not pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison ! ''
'' so here we are , back on shore '' , Conseil said .
I kept on working , but the temperature rose to the point of becoming unbearable .
my mistake . it wanted to retreat , but the unearthly animal came at us with a speed double our own .
I turned and discovered the captain .
'' yes , sir '' .
'' what are they , Captain ? '' I asked .
'' then , sir , with your permission , I will bid you good evening '' .
'' were not its eyes prominently placed and considerably enlarged ? ''
the captain stood up and invited me to follow him . I ' d had time to collect myself . I did so . the lounge was dark , but the sea s waves sparkled through the transparent windows . I stared .
'' ye gods '' , the Canadian shot back , '' I am starting to appreciate the charms of cannibalism ! ''
meanwhile , crazed with terror , the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat . as for us , half laughing , we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land , who was swearing like one possessed .
in less than twenty minutes , swept along by the torrent , the Nautilus had just cleared the Isthmus of Suez .
'' to speak with you , Captain '' .
it was the ship s commander who had just spoken .
'' infinitely rich , sir , and without any trouble , I could pay off the tenbillionfranc French national debt ! ''
after a fairly long silence , the commander went on with our conversation .
'' are mussels included too ? '' the Canadian asked .
a seaman could not be wrong on this topic , and I told the Canadian what had gone on while he slept .
'' good ! '' the Canadian replied . '' from now on we ll pay closer attention to em '' .
Captain Nemo was waiting for me .
'' in any event we are already clear '' , the Canadian replied , '' because we are afloat '' .
after I monitored the operation s progress , doublechecking it with many inspections , I told the captain , '' it s working '' .
'' not at all , my boy . that was a stroke of genius , catching one of these live birds with your bare hands ! ''
'' Master is well aware '' , Conseil replied , '' that I am not seasoned in practical application . when Master has told me these animals ' names ... ''
'' do not give up so easily , Conseil , '' the Canadian replied .
'' aye , sir '' , the engineer replied .
'' positively , sir '' .
'' well , Ned my friend , we ll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th , because it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away ! ''
near eleven oclock in the evening , I received a most unexpected visit from Captain Nemo . he asked me very graciously if I felt exhausted from our vigil the night before . I said no .
'' yes . it
'' nothing can save him ? ''
'' but Ned , you are a professional whaler , a man familiar with all the great marine mammals -- your mind should easily accept this hypothesis of an enormous cetacean , and you ought to be the last one to doubt it under these circumstances ! ''
I entered the captain s stateroom . it had an austere , almost monastic appearance . an iron bedstead , a worktable , some washstand fixtures . subdued lighting . no luxuries . just the bare necessities .
this said , Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus s interior , followed by his chief officer . as for our craft , it no longer stirred , staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it in with their indestructible cement .
'' then I would ask what you mean by this freedom '' .
'' but how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret ? ''
'' and could you kindly tell me what everybody knows ? '' he asked me in a gently ironic tone .
'' now '' , Captain Nemo said , '' let s look for our passageway '' .
'' here we are '' , the Captain said .
'' yes '' , I replied , '' because we are going in the direction of the sun , and here the sun is due north '' .
'' only if they are attacked '' , I replied . '' but when these giant seals defend their little ones , their fury is dreadful , and it is not rare for them to smash a fisherman s longboat to bits '' .
'' but what is it that startles you ? ''
'' call it anything you like '' .
'' a company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these sunken galleons . the company s investors were lured by the bait of enormous gains , because this scuttled treasure is estimated to be worth 500000000 francs . ''
by then Commander Farragut , Ned Land , and I were on the afterdeck , peering eagerly into the profound gloom .
'' my friends '' , I said , '' we must not despair . we ve gotten out of tighter spots . so please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your views on the commander and crew of this boat . ''
but Commander Farragut did not want to waste a single day , or even a single hour , in making for those seas where the animal had just been sighted . he summoned his engineer .
'' go ahead , then ! '' Commander Farragut called .
'' unfortunately '' , Ned Land said , '' they ve only given us the standard menu '' .
Captain Nemo stopped . I admit it : I still could not see how this piece of history concerned me .
'' whatever you say , Ned '' . then , trying to imitate Captain Nemo s carefree tone , I asked , '' by the way , gallant Ned , are you afraid of sharks ? ''
'' someone is sick ? ''
'' we are going , Mr Ned , where the Captain s fancy takes us '' .
the next morning , February 19 , I beheld the Canadian entering my stateroom . I was expecting this visit . he wore an expression of great disappointment .
our forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled . the cannoneer fired a shot , but his shell passed some feet above the cetacean , which stayed half a mile off .
'' it was 500000000 francs '' , Captain Nemo replied , '' but no more ! ''
'' but how will we set out ? ''
'' why not ? ''
'' I imagine not '' , I replied , '' but he will not want to sample them '' .
'' I am all attention '' .
'' or in other words , on our gigantic narwhale '' .
'' so long as it navigates horizontally '' , Ned Land muttered , '' I ve no complaints . but if it gets the urge to dive , I would not give $ 200 for my hide ! ''
'' fine . stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam ! ''
'' I will not argue with you '' , Ned Land answered . '' but dinner or breakfast , that steward will be plenty welcome whether he brings the one or the other '' .
'' are we up to pressure ? '' he asked the man .
'' what about the frigate ? '' I asked .
'' am I disturbing you ? '' I said out of politeness .
'' right now , Professor , the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water , and we ve only to depart '' .
before Conseil could finish his sentence , Ned Land scooted down the hatch and ran to look for the captain . a few moments later , the two of them reappeared on the platform .
'' precisely , and that s what I came to tell you -- ''
the outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided into five major parts : the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans , the Indian Ocean , the Atlantic Ocean , and the Pacific Ocean .
'' my friends '' , I said , '' to a question couched in these terms , our answer can be taken for granted . but no solemn promises bind us to the commander of this vessel . ''
'' then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus , I do not see how you can force it down into the heart of these liquid masses '' .
'' the hotel will keep them for us '' .
what a predicament ! we were rocking frightfully . the Nautilus defended itself like a human being . its steel muscles were cracking . sometimes it stood on end , the three of us along with it !
'' agreed . and now , Ned , will you tell me what you mean by a promising opportunity ? ''
just then I was studying a delightful book by Jean Mace , The Servants of the Stomach , and savoring its ingenious teachings , when Conseil interrupted my reading .
'' a mere nothing , sir '' .
'' very easily '' .
'' an indisputable event , my gallant Ned . accordingly , people have proposed naming this devilfish Bouguer s squid '' .
'' Conseil ! '' I shouted . '' Conseil ! ''
'' 193 miles per hour , sir '' .
'' is there any immediate danger ? ''
'' until now , however , I ve seen only clear waves , without any unique hue '' .
'' Ned ! '' I exclaimed .
'' what ! '' Conseil put in . '' squid , ordinary squid from the class Cephalopoda ? ''
'' but I did not say we ' d return to Europe '' .
but no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .
'' it can not be ! '' Conseil exclaimed .
'' and what are you going to do ? ''
it was obvious that we did not understand each other .
'' the sea is rough '' , I said .
'' I think we are trapped , Captain '' .
'' look ! look ! '' the Canadian exclaimed , his voice full of excitement . '' it s approaching ! it s coming toward us ! it s thumbing its nose at me ! it knows I can not do a blessed thing to it ! ''
'' over to somebody with better aim ! '' the commander shouted . '' and $ 50000 to the man who can pierce that infernal beast ! ''
'' here s what I found at the very site of that final shipwreck ! ''
'' in a church ! '' the Canadian exclaimed .
'' then , Professor Aronnax , I propose an unusual excursion '' .
Ned Land did not reply . his pursed lips and frowning brow indicated that he was in the grip of his monomania .
'' at close quarters ? '' I repeated .
'' finally , we are upright ! '' I exclaimed .
'' a speed of fifty miles per hour '' .
as soon as I was dressed , I made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted .
'' why , Ned , why ? ''
'' no , Ned '' .
Ned Land could not conceal his glee . he was a prisoner escaping from prison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it .
'' how true ! ''
soon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon , and our course was set to the northwest , toward the tip of the Indian peninsula .
'' never , sir '' , the captain said , swiftly interrupting me .
'' in sight of land . I saw it through the mists just this morning , twenty miles to the east '' .
'' begging master s indulgence '' , Conseil replied , '' but our friend Ned is concocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder ! ''
'' this ll mean a delay '' , Ned said .
'' but Professor '' , our irascible companion went on , '' can not you see that we could die of hunger in this iron cage ? ''
this inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good while without replying .
the Nautilus kept to an eastnortheasterly heading , a speed of twelve miles per hour , and a depth between fifty and sixty meters .
'' no , sir '' , he replied , '' this time an accident '' .
'' farther south ? '' I asked , gaping at the captain .
'' at least a hundred '' .
I was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of algae , when I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling by , throwing off phosphorescent glimmers .
'' and how long was it ? '' the Canadian asked .
I stood up , went , leaned on my elbows before the window , and I saw it .
'' that would be gambling with the lives of my men '' .
'' we are about to depart '' , he said .
'' but Ned my friend '' , Conseil said , '' why not ask Captain Nemo for permission to hunt -- ''
'' surely , but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf , you will note its odd appearance . I recall seeing the Bay of El TUR completely red , like a lake of blood '' .
'' what if we do not return to the Nautilus this evening ? '' Conseil said .
'' if you do not mind , Professor '' , Captain Nemo told me , '' we ll determine our exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage . it s fifteen minutes before noon . I am going to rise to the surface of the water '' .
'' but , sir '' , the Canadian went on , '' in the Red Sea you authorized us to chase a dugong ! ''
so I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape . my baggage was not heavy . my notes , nothing more .
'' from its rigging and its low masts '' , the Canadian replied , '' I bet it s a warship . here s hoping it pulls up and sinks this damned Nautilus ! ''
'' nothing '' .
'' what s this ? they are firing at us ! '' I exclaimed .
'' well , Professor Aronnax '' , Captain Nemo answered me , '' we are actually in that Bay of Vigo , and all that s left is for you to probe the mysteries of the place '' .
it was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus , the old shepherd of King Neptune s flocks : an island located between Rhodes and Crete , which Greeks now call Karpathos , Italians Scarpanto . through the lounge window I could see only its granite bedrock .
'' how beautiful ! '' Conseil exclaimed .
'' the same '' , I replied . '' Commander Farragut ? ''
'' or rather his bank vaults . by which I mean this ocean , where his wealth is safer than in any national treasury '' .
Pierre Aronnax , Professor at the Paris Museum , Fifth Avenue Hotel , New York .
'' where ? I do not know . when ? I can not say . or , rather , I suppose it will be over when these seas have nothing more to teach us . everything that begins in this world must inevitably come to an end '' .
'' branch Mollusca '' , Conseil said , '' class Acephala , order Testacea '' .
'' you mean you can control this heat ? ''
'' we are yours to command , Captain '' .
'' yes , precisely '' .
just then , in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon , I spotted a face that was not Conseil s but which I recognized at once .
'' we will go with you '' , I said . and we followed Captain Nemo , heading to the central companionway .
I received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left its Brooklyn Pier ; the letter read as follows :
'' I follow you '' , I said . '' but while they are simple to do , such calculations can give only a very uncertain figure '' .
'' all right , at noon we ll find out what our position is ! ''
'' that s the standard equipment for a diving suit , '' I said .
'' sharks ? '' I exclaimed .
'' it s one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn . for ships a mere reef , for us an immense cavern . I discovered it by chance , and chance served me well '' .
'' me ? '' the Canadian replied '' . I am a professional harpooner ! it s my job to make a mockery of them ! ''
'' a hunting trip ! '' Ned exclaimed .
Commander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods .
'' no matter how faintly it shines , it will be enough for me '' , the captain replied .
however , one bird unique to these shores , which never passes beyond the boundaries of the ARU and Papuan islands , was missing from this collection . but I was given a chance to marvel at it soon enough .
'' sir '' , I told the captain , '' thank you for placing this library at my disposal . there are scientific treasures here , and I will take advantage of them '' .
'' under it ? ''
'' I warn you , this will be an exhausting stroll . we will need to walk long hours and scale a mountain . the roads are not terribly well kept up '' .
I hesitated to speak my mind .
'' look '' .
'' indeed '' , Conseil said . '' but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls ? ''
'' true , sir , very true '' , I replied with growing excitement .
this cell , properly speaking , was the Nautilus s arsenal and wardrobe . hanging from its walls , a dozen diving outfits were waiting for anybody who wanted to take a stroll .
Captain Nemo stood up . I followed him . contrived at the rear of the dining room , a double door opened , and I entered a room whose dimensions equaled the one I had just left .
assuredly , if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land s harpoon , I would not bet on the monster .
'' noon ! '' I called .
ceasing all movement for an instant , we listened . and it may have been a ringing in my ear , from this organ filling with impeded blood , but it seemed to me that Conseil s shout had received an answer back .
'' oh , the rascal ! '' Conseil exclaimed . '' I ' d rather he cracked my shoulder ! ''
'' because this bird is as drunk as a lord '' .
'' go to it , Ned '' , Commander Farragut replied . '' engineer '' , he called , '' keep the pressure mounting ! ''
sailors rushed to the helm , engineers to their machinery . under reverse steam immediately , the Abraham Lincoln beat to port , sweeping in a semicircle .
'' pretty nearly , Ned '' .
'' precisely '' .
I fell silent . Captain Nemo stood up .
'' this is outrageous ! '' Ned Land shouted , exploding for the twentieth time . '' I ask you ! we speak French , English , German , and Latin to these rogues , and neither of them has the decency to even answer back ! ''
'' it s only a cluster of phosphorescent particles ! '' exclaimed one of the officers .
'' it always floats '' .
'' as simple as that '' .
'' all right '' , the Canadian said , '' then why should there be any more than that ? ''
I was mulling this over when the captain approached , cool and calm , forever in control of himself , looking neither alarmed nor annoyed .
'' tit for tat '' , Captain Nemo told the Canadian . '' I owed it to myself ! ''
'' would master '' , Conseil said to me , '' give us some background on pearl fishing ? ''

'' surely . we are cruising in a current of boiling water '' .
'' right , Ned , and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict if it were launched with the speed of an express train against a ship s hull '' .
'' I ve given orders to open the hatches '' .
so those millions had been delivered to their address . at what spot on the continent ? who was the recipient of Captain Nemo s gold ?
'' nevertheless , it will have to do ! ''
'' how many men do you think are on board the Nautilus ? ''
'' not in the least '' .
'' indeed '' , I replied , '' here you are in perfect safety , Captain Nemo . who could reach you in the heart of a volcano ? but do not I see an opening at its summit ? ''
these orders were executed , and the frigate swiftly retreated from this core of light .
'' we are floating on its surface , Ned my friend '' .
'' at my command . an electric wire connects me to the ship . I fire off a telegram , and that s that . ''
'' I ve no idea . but wherever it s from , it will sink before nightfall . in any event , it s better to perish with it than be accomplices in some act of revenge whose merits we can not gauge '' .
'' it s worth trying ! '' I said resolutely .
ten of his companions followed him . all ten met the same fate .
the entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain Nemo . the panels in the lounge did nt open . perhaps they did not want us to get tired of these beautiful things .
'' extremely well , my gallant lad '' , I replied . '' and how about you , Mr Ned Land ? ''
'' can one find several pearls in the same oyster ? '' Conseil asked .
near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue , but behind us all the way to the horizon , the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of an aurora borealis .
in wonderment , we leaned on our elbows before these show windows , and our stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said : '' you wanted to see something , Ned my friend ; well , now you have something to see ! ''
'' but does this mean the old boy goes ashore ? '' Ned Land went on .
'' yes ! '' I said . '' but what can we do ? ''
'' they will be useless to us '' , he replied .
'' what can we do , Ned , since it is not feasible to escape right now ? ''
'' ask , Professor '' .
'' take a good look '' , Ned went on . '' there , ahead to starboard , almost level with the beacon ! do not you see a mass that seems to be moving around ? ''
'' it remains to be seen '' , I said , '' whether these forests do contain game , and if the types of game are not of such size that they can hunt the hunter '' .
Captain Nemo , commander of the Nautilus .
just then something hard banged against me . I clung to it . then I felt myself being pulled upward , back to the surface of the water ; my chest caved in , and I fainted ...
'' my dear sir , have you forgotten that the Nautilus is armed with a fearsome spur ? could not it be launched diagonally against those tracts of ice , which would break open from the impact ? ''
'' it s marvelous '' , I replied , '' and I truly see , Captain , how right you are to use this force ; it s sure to take the place of wind , water , and steam '' .
'' what I ve got to tell you is very simple '' , the Canadian replied . '' we are in Europe , and before Captain Nemo s whims take us deep into the polar seas or back to Oceania , I say we should leave this Nautilus '' .
well , no . the blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished with no overlapping scales . on impact , it gave off a metallic sonority , and as incredible as this sounds , it seemed , I swear , to be made of riveted plates .
'' all the more reason you should go look him up '' .
near one oclock , Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt . speaking for myself , I was glad to oblige , and we stretched out beneath an arbor of winged kelp , whose long thin tendrils stood up like arrows .
'' hunt them ? what for ? '' Captain Nemo replied . '' simply to destroy them ? we have no use for whale oil on this ship '' .
right now , nothing is clear to me , I still glimpse only glimmers in the dark , and I must limit my pen , as it were , to taking dictation from events .
'' we accept '' , I replied . '' only , I will ask your permission , sir , to address a question to you , just one '' .
'' as for asphyxiation , Captain '' , I replied , '' that is not a cause for alarm , because the air tanks are full '' .
and with that , Captain Nemo left the lounge .
'' they are seals and walruses '' .
after a few minutes , the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were completely toasted . on the inside there appeared some white pasta , a sort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke .
'' now , Ned , we are all ears '' , I said . '' what have you to tell us ? ''
'' which means '' , the Canadian went on , '' since I ve never fished these waterways , I do not know the whales that frequent them ? ''
'' yes ! the mussels of certain streams in Scotland , Wales , Ireland , Saxony , Bohemia , and France '' .
'' and will we see your companions at work ? ''
'' often , sir , but never a whale like this , whose sighting earned me $ 200000 '' .
'' yes , Ned ! we will escape tonight even if the sea swallows us up ! ''
'' kindly follow me '' .
'' Professor '' , he said to me , '' would it be convenient for you to make an underwater excursion today ? ''
'' then we have ample time to finish our voyage '' , Conseil replied , '' if Ned Land does not mess things up ! ''
I had one question left to address to Captain Nemo .
my reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo . but not knowing what he was driving at , I waited for further questions , ready to reply as circumstances dictated .
I wanted to run to the captain s rescue . but I was transfixed with horror , unable to move .
at the captain s signal we returned to the bank of shellfish , and retracing our steps , we walked for half an hour until we encountered the anchor connecting the seafloor with the Nautilus s skiff .
'' precisely '' , I replied .
'' will Master '' , the gallant lad said to me , '' allow me to wish him a happy new year ? ''
'' it would not displease me one bit '' .
my head struck against an iron timber , and with this violent shock I lost consciousness .
'' ah , Commander '' , I exclaimed with conviction , '' your Nautilus is truly a marvelous boat ! ''
Conseil s unflappable composure cheered me up . I swam more vigorously , but hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made of lead , I was managing with only the greatest difficulty . Conseil noticed as much .
just then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks were filling , and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic .
'' go on , sir '' , I replied . '' I assume this condition is one an honest man can accept ? ''
'' does anybody fish for em nowadays ? '' the Canadian asked .
'' and you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae ? ''
'' it will not take a minute '' , the Canadian replied .
'' very little of it '' , I replied .
'' agreed '' , I said '' . and steam seems to have killed off all gratitude in seamen s hearts . but since you seem to have made a special study of this sea , Captain , can you tell me how it got its name ? ''
'' but what hour is it , then ? '' the Canadian asked .
'' that s fine '' , Ned Land answered . '' I accept the explanation , but in our personal interests , I am sorry this opening the professor mentions was not made above sea level '' .
'' in the harbor ? '' Ned Land said sarcastically .
'' set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile '' .
'' and now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery ? ''
'' I am unable to say , my friend '' .
'' did we strike bottom ? '' I asked .
'' no '' , I said , '' devilfish of large dimensions . but friend Land is no doubt mistaken , because I do not see a thing '' .
'' open your eyes ! open your eyes ! '' repeated the sailors of the Abraham Lincoln .
I was hard pressed by Ned Land s common sense , and I felt myself losing ground . I no longer knew what arguments to put forward on my behalf .
'' perhaps this is the same as the Alecto s '' , Conseil said .
after crossing a pretty lush prairie , we arrived on the outskirts of a small wood , enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large number of birds .
on January 1 , 1868 , bright and early , Conseil joined me on the platform .
'' what about the Papuans ? ''
'' well ? '' Captain Nemo went on . '' did you hear my question ? do you know the history of Spain ? ''
'' to the Nautilus '' , he said .
'' because I ve seen big baleen whales , sir , whales measuring up to 100 feet long ! I ve even heard that those rorqual whales off the Aleutian Islands sometimes get over 150 feet . ''
'' we are boxed in ? ''
'' only I ve no idea what time it is , Professor Aronnax , unless maybe it s dinnertime ? ''
'' why , the freedom to come , go , see , and even closely observe everything happening here -- except under certain rare circumstances -- in short , the freedom we ourselves enjoy , my companions and I '' .
'' the thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go , if it s to double the Cape of Good Hope , circle around Africa , and lie in the open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow '' .

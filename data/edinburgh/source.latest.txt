there I found Conseil , who wished to know the result of my interview with the Captain .
'' yes , Captain , although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat '' .
'' so shall I '' , replied Ned Land .
'' no , my friend . what is Ned Land doing ? ''
'' they are southern whales '' , said he ; '' there goes the fortune of a whole fleet of whalers '' .
'' and mine too '' , simply said the harpooner .
'' at St. Malo '' , answered Conseil .
'' no '' , said I ; '' the creature is wounded -- look at the blood ; but your weapon has not stuck in his body '' .
'' you may speak '' , said the captain . '' this man does not understand French '' .
'' good ! '' said Conseil ; '' a concert of bulls ! ''
I cast a last look at the man-of-war , which was putting on steam , and rejoined Ned and Conseil .
Conseil was in ecstasy . Ned Land , carried away by his violent instincts , rushed on to the staircase . but the moment he seized the rail with both hands , he , in his turn , was overthrown .
'' see ! '' exclaimed the harpooner , '' but we can see nothing in this iron prison ! we are walking -- we are sailing -- blindly '' .
'' agreed , Captain ! ''
'' soundly , Professor . but , I do not know if I am right or not , there seems to be a sea breeze ! ''
'' yes , Captain Nemo '' , I replied ; '' and the Nautilus is wonderfully fitted for such a study . ah ! it is an intelligent boat ! ''
'' well , we must accept '' , said the Canadian . '' but once more on dry ground , we shall know what to do . indeed , I shall not be sorry to eat a piece of fresh venison '' .
'' here we are , once more on land '' , said Conseil .
I continued my work , but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be intolerable .
I was mistaken . she tried to sheer off , but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own .
I turned , and saw the Captain .
'' yes , sir '' .
'' what are they , Captain ? ''
'' then , sir , if you will allow me , I will wish you good night '' .
'' had not its eyes , placed at the back of its head , considerable development ? ''
the captain rose , telling me to follow him . I had had time to recover . I obeyed . the saloon was dark , but through the transparent glass the waves were sparkling . I looked .
'' my word ! '' returned the Canadian '' , I begin to understand the charms of anthropophagy '' .
meanwhile , the exasperated Papuans had beaten a retreat paralyzed with terror . as for us , half laughing , we consoled and rubbed the unfortunate Ned Land , who swore like one possessed .
in less than twenty minutes , the Nautilus , carried along by the torrent , had passed through the Isthmus of Suez .
'' to speak to you , Captain '' .
it was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke .
'' immensely rich , sir ; and I could , without missing it , pay the national debt of France '' .
after rather a long silence , the commander resumed the conversation .
'' mussels too ? '' asked the Canadian .
a seaman could not be mistaken , and I told the Canadian all that had passed during his sleep .
'' good ! for the future I shall pay attention '' , replied the Canadian .
Captain Nemo was awaiting me .
'' in any case '' , replied the Canadian , '' we shall be free , for we are floating '' .
'' we shall succeed '' , I said to the Captain , after having anxiously watched the result of the operation .
'' no , my boy ; you have made an excellent stroke . take one of these living birds , and carry it in your hand . ''
'' sir '' , said Conseil , '' will you tell me the names of these creatures ? ''
'' Conseil , we must not despair , '' said the Canadian .
'' yes , sir '' , replied the engineer .
'' just so , sir '' .
'' well , friend Ned , we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th instant ; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it off again '' .
that night , about eleven o'clock , I received a most unexpected visit from Captain Nemo . he asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from my watch of the preceding night . I answered in the negative .
'' yes '' .
'' can nothing save him ? ''
'' but , Ned , you , a whaler by profession , familiarized with all the great marine mammalia -- you ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances ! ''
I entered the captain 's room : it had a severe , almost a monkish aspect . a small iron bedstead , a table , some articles for the toilet ; the whole lighted by a skylight . no comforts , the strictest necessaries only .
having said this , Captain Nemo , followed by his lieutenant , redescended to the interior of the Nautilus . as to the vessel , it moved not , and was immovable , as if the coral line polypi had already walled it up with their in destructible cement .
'' I ask you , then , what you mean by this liberty ? ''
'' but how could you construct this wonderful Nautilus in secret ? ''
'' and could you tell me what everyone knows about it ? '' he inquired , ironically .
'' now '' , said Captain Nemo , '' let us try to make our passage '' .
'' we have arrived '' , said the Captain .
'' yes '' , I replied , '' for we are going the way of the sun , and here the sun is in the north '' .
'' no ; not unless you attack them . when they have to defend their young their rage is terrible , and it is not uncommon for them to break the fishing-boats to pieces '' .
'' but the cause of this surprise ? ''
'' give it what name you please '' .
'' a society which has received from the Spanish government the privilege of seeking those buried galleons . the shareholders are led on by the allurement of an enormous bounty , for they value these rich shipwrecks at five hundred millions . ''
the captain , Ned Land , and I were then on the poop , eagerly peering through the profound darkness .
'' my friends '' , I said , '' we must not despair . we have been worse off than this . do me the favor to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat . ''
but Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted . he sent for the engineer .
'' go ahead '' , cried Commander Farragut .
'' unfortunately '' , said Ned Land , '' they have only given us the ship 's fare '' .
Captain Nemo stopped . I admit I could not see yet why this history should interest me .
'' as you say , Ned . by the bye '' , said I , trying to take Captain Nemo 's careless tone '' , are you afraid of sharks , brave Ned ? ''
'' is he ill ? ''
'' we are going where our Captain 's fancy takes us , Master Ned '' .
the next morning , the 19 th of February , I saw the Canadian enter my room . I expected this visit . he looked very disappointed .
the forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round . but the shot passed some feet above the cetacean , which was half a mile off .
'' five hundred millions they were '' , answered Captain Nemo , '' but they are so no longer '' .
'' but how shall we get off ? ''
'' why not ? ''
'' I do not think he would , but he would not taste them '' .
'' I listen '' .
'' or , more correctly speaking , on our gigantic narwhal '' .
'' as long as it sails horizontally '' , muttered Ned Land , '' I do not mind ; but , if it takes a fancy to dive , I would not give two straws for my life '' .
'' well , make up your fires and put on all steam '' .
'' I will not contradict you '' , replied Ned Land . '' but , dinner or breakfast , the steward will be welcome , whichever he brings '' .
'' is the steam full on ? '' asked he .
'' and the frigate ? '' I asked .
'' I am disturbing you '' , said I , for courtesy 's sake .
'' at this moment , Professor , the Nautilus is stranded in five fathoms , and we have nothing to do but to start '' .
Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself through the panel to seek the captain . a few minutes afterwards the two appeared together on the platform .
'' exactly , and I came to say to you -- ''
the shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great portions : the Arctic or Frozen Ocean , the Antarctic , or Frozen Ocean , the Indian , the Atlantic , and the Pacific Oceans .
'' my friends '' , said I , '' to a question thus put , there is nothing to answer . but no word of honor binds us to the master of this vessel . ''
'' then , unless you quite fill the Nautilus , I do not see how you can draw it down to those depths '' .
'' they will keep them at the hotel '' .
what a situation to be in ! we rocked frightfully . the Nautilus defended itself like a human being . its steel muscles cracked . sometimes it seemed to stand upright , and we with it !
'' agreed ! and now , Ned , will you tell me what you mean by a favorable opportunity ? ''
I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace , The Slaves of the Stomach , and I was learning some valuable lessons from it , when Conseil interrupted me .
'' nothing , sir '' .
'' easily '' .
'' an indisputable fact , my good Ned . they proposed to name this poulp ' Bouguer 's cuttlefish ' . ''
'' Conseil ! '' cried I . '' Conseil ! ''
'' nineteen miles and three-tenths , sir '' .
'' is the danger immediate ? ''
'' but up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and without any particular color '' .
'' Ned ! '' I cried .
'' what ! '' said Conseil ; '' cuttlefish , real cuttlefish of the cephalopod class ? ''
'' but I never said we were going back to Europe '' .
but my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly snatched out of my hands .
'' is it possible ? ''
'' what are you going to do ? ''
it was evident that we did not understand one another .
'' the sea is bad '' .
'' I think that we are caught , Captain '' .
'' look ! look ! '' exclaimed the Canadian , '' they approach : they aggravate me ; they know that I cannot get at them ! ''
'' another , more to the right , '' cried the commander , '' and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast '' .
'' by this , that I found on the spot where was the last wreck '' .
'' in a church ! '' cried the Canadian .
'' then , M. Aronnax , I propose a curious excursion '' .
Ned Land did not answer ; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind .
'' man to beast ? '' I repeated .
'' at last we have righted ! '' I exclaimed .
'' a speed of fifty miles an hour '' .
as soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon . it was deserted . I plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses .
'' why , Ned , why ? ''
'' no , Ned '' .
Ned Land could not restrain his joy . he was like a prisoner that had escaped from prison , and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it .
'' indeed ! ''
soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon , and our course was directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula .
'' never , sir ! '' he said , hastily interrupting me .
'' in sight of land . I took the reckoning this morning in the fog -- twenty miles to the east '' .
'' if you will excuse me , sir '' , answered Conseil , '' friend Ned is busy making a kangaroo-pie which will be a marvel '' .
'' it will be a hindrance '' , said Ned .
'' but do you see , Professor '' , replied our irascible companion , '' that we shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage ? ''
I so little expected such a question that I stared some time at him without answering .
the course of the Nautilus was E.N.E. , her speed twelve knots , the depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms .
'' no , sir ; an accident this time '' .
'' further to the south ? '' I asked , looking at the captain .
'' a hundred at least '' .
I was stretched on the ground , just under the shelter of a bush of algae , when , raising my head , I saw some enormous mass , casting phosphorescent gleams , pass blusteringly by .
'' what length was it ? '' asked the Canadian .
I rose , went , and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched .
'' that will be trifling with the lives of my men '' .
'' we are going to start '' , said he .
'' but , friend Ned '' , said Conseil , '' why do you not ask Captain Nemo 's permission to chase them ? ''
'' very likely ; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf , you will see this singular appearance . I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely red , like a sea of blood '' .
'' suppose we do not return to the Nautilus this evening ? '' said Conseil .
'' sir '' , said Captain Nemo , '' we will , if you please , take our bearings and fix the starting-point of this voyage . it is a quarter to twelve ; I will go up again to the surface . ''
'' but , sir '' , continued the Canadian , '' in the Red Sea you allowed us to follow the dugong '' .
I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight . my luggage was not heavy ; my notes , nothing more .
'' by its rigging , and the height of its lower masts '' , said the Canadian , '' I bet she is a ship-of-war . may it reach us ; and , if necessary , sink this cursed Nautilus . ''
'' nothing '' .
'' what ! they are firing at us ! '' I exclaimed .
'' well , M. Aronnax '' , replied Captain Nemo , '' we are in that Vigo Bay ; and it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries '' .
it was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus , the old shepherd of Neptune 's flocks , now the Island of Scarpanto , situated between Rhodes and Crete . I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels of the saloon .
'' how beautiful ! how beautiful ! '' cried Conseil .
'' himself '' , replied I . '' Commander Farragut ? ''
'' or rather his banking-house ; by that I mean the ocean , where his riches are safer than in the chests of the state '' .
to M. Aronnax , Professor in the Museum of Paris , Fifth Avenue Hotel , New York .
'' where I do not know -- when I cannot say ; or , rather , I suppose it will end when these seas have nothing more to teach us '' .
'' branch of molluscs '' , said Conseil .
'' you can reduce it as you please , then ? ''
'' we obey your orders , Captain '' .
'' precisely '' .
just then , by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to the horizon , I saw a face which was not Conseil 's and which I immediately recognized .
'' we will follow you '' , I said , and , following Captain Nemo , we went towards the central staircase .
three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn pier , I received a letter worded as follows :
'' I understand '' , said I ; '' but that calculation , though simple enough , can give but a very uncertain result '' .
'' well , at noon we shall see the point '' .
'' that is a diving apparatus '' , said I .
'' sharks ! '' exclaimed I .
'' it belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is strewn -- to vessels a simple sand-bank -- to us an immense cavern . chance led me to discover it , and chance served me well . ''
'' I ! '' replied the Canadian ; '' a harpooner by profession ? it is my trade to make light of them '' .
'' a hunt ! '' exclaimed Ned .
the captain then decided to take more direct means .
'' however little it shows , it will be enough , '' replied the Captain .
however , a bird peculiar to these lands , and which has never passed the limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands , was wanting in this collection . but fortune reserved it for me before long .
'' sir '' , said I to the captain , '' I thank you for having placed this library at my disposal . it contains treasures of science , and I shall profit by them '' .
'' beneath it ? ''
'' I warn you , the way will be tiring . we shall have far to walk , and must climb a mountain . the roads are not well kept '' .
I hesitated before giving it .
'' look '' .
'' certainly not '' , said Conseil ; '' but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls ? ''
'' just so , sir -- just so '' , I replied , getting animated .
this cell was , to speak correctly , the arsenal and wardrobe of the Nautilus . a dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting our use .
Captain Nemo rose . I followed him . a double door , contrived at the back of the dining-room , opened , and I entered a room equal in dimensions to that which I had just quitted .
decidedly , if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land 's harpoon , I would not bet in its favor .
'' twelve ! '' I exclaimed .
our movements were suspended for an instant ; we listened . it might be only a singing in the ear , but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the cry from Conseil .
'' ah ! The scoundrel ! '' cried Conseil ; '' I would rather he had broken my shoulder ! ''
'' because this bird is as drunk as a quail '' .
'' go , Ned '' , said the captain . '' engineer , put on more pressure '' .
the steam was shut off , and the Abraham Lincoln , beating to port , described a semi-circle .
'' very nearly , Ned '' .
'' precisely '' .
I was silenced ; Captain Nemo rose .
'' it is an infamous shame '' , cried Ned Land , who broke out for the twentieth time . '' we speak to those rogues in French , English , German , and Latin , and not one of them has the politeness to answer ! ''
'' it is only a massing of phosphoric particles '' , cried one of the officers .
'' it always floats '' .
'' really '' .
'' well , why should there be any more ? ''
I was reflecting thus , when the Captain , cool and calm , always master of himself , approached me .
'' I owed myself this revenge ! '' said the Captain to the Canadian .
'' sir '' , said Conseil , '' would you give us some details of the pearl fishery ? ''

'' the only difficulty '' , continued Captain Nemo , '' is that of remaining several days without renewing our provision of air '' .
'' certainly ; we are floating in a current of boiling water '' .
'' as you say , Ned . and think what destruction such a mass would cause , if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel . ''
'' I have given the order to open the hatches '' .
so these millions had been transported to their address . to what point of the continent ? who was Captain Nemo 's correspondent ?
'' it must suffice you , however '' .
'' how many men are there on board the Nautilus , do you think ? ''
'' hardly '' .
'' certainly '' , I replied , '' you are in safety here , Captain Nemo . who could reach you in the heart of a volcano ? but did I not see an opening at its summit ? ''
these orders were executed , and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light .
'' we are floating on its surface , friend Ned '' .
'' by my orders . an electric thread connects us . I telegraph to it , and that is enough . ''
'' I do not know ; but , whatever it is , it will be sunk before night . in any case , it is better to perish with it , than be made accomplices in a retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge '' .
'' let us try it '' , I said resolutely .
ten of his companions followed him . they met with the same fate .
the whole day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain Nemo . the panels of the saloon did not open . perhaps they did not wish us to tire of these beautiful things .
'' very well , my brave boy . and you , Mr. Land ? ''
'' are many pearls found in the same oyster ? '' asked Conseil .
towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual color ; but behind us , even to the limits of the horizon , the sky reflected the whitened waves , and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis .
'' you wished to see , friend Ned ; well , you see now '' .
'' oh ! then the gentleman is going on terra firma ? '' replied Ned Land .
'' yes ; but what is to be done ? ''
'' they will be useless '' , he replied .
'' what is to be done , Ned , since flight is impracticable just now ? ''
'' ask it , Professor '' .
'' look well '' , said Ned '' , there , on the starboard beam , about the height of the lantern ! do you not see a mass which seems to move ? ''
'' it remains to be seen '' , I said , '' if these forests are full of game , and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself '' .
Captain Nemo , commander of the Nautilus .
at this moment a hard body struck me . I clung to it : then I felt that I was being drawn up , that I was brought to the surface of the water , that my chest collapsed -- I fainted .
'' good , sir ! but do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with a powerful spur , and could we not send it diagonally against these fields of ice , which would open at the shocks '' .
'' it is marvelous ! and I see , Captain , you were right to make use of this agent that takes the place of wind , water , and steam '' .
'' what I have to tell you is very simple . we are in Europe ; and before Captain Nemo 's caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the polar seas , or lead us into Oceania , I ask to leave the Nautilus '' .
well , no ! the blackish back that supported me was smooth , polished , without scales . the blow produced a metallic sound ; and , incredible though it may be , it seemed , I might say , as if it was made of riveted plates .
'' that is all the more reason for you to go to see him '' .
in about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt ; I , for my part , was not sorry , and we stretched ourselves under an arbor of alariae , the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows .
'' and to what purpose ? '' replied Captain Nemo ; '' only to destroy ! we have nothing to do with the whale - oil on board '' .
at this moment nothing is clear to me ; I catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness , and I must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate .
'' we accept '' , I answered ; '' only I will ask your permission , sir , to address one question to you -- one only '' .
'' as to suffocation , Captain '' , I replied , '' that is not to be feared , because our reservoirs are full '' .
whereupon he turned and left the saloon .
'' they are seals and morses '' .
after some minutes , the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire was completely roasted . the interior looked like a white pasty , a sort of soft crumb , the flavor of which was like that of an artichoke .
'' now , Ned , we listen ; what have you to tell us ? ''
'' in that case , as I have never fished in these seas , I do not know the kind of whale frequenting them ! ''
'' yes , mussels of certain waters in Scotland , Wales , Ireland , Saxony , Bohemia , and France '' .
'' and we shall see your companions at work ? ''
'' often , sir ; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars . if I can only approach within four harpoons ' length of it ! ''
'' yes , Ned , yes . we will fly to-night , even if the sea should swallow us up . ''
'' then please to follow me '' .
'' Professor , will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion to-day ? ''
'' then '' , said Conseil , '' we shall have time to finish our journey -- that is , if Ned Land does not interfere with it '' .
one last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo .
my answer had evidently satisfied the captain . but , not knowing what he would say next , I waited for other questions , reserving my answers according to circumstances .
I wanted to go to the Captain 's assistance , but , nailed to the spot with horror , I could not stir .
at a sign from the Captain we regained the bank , and , following the road already traversed , came in about half an hour to the anchor which held the canoe of the Nautilus to the earth .
'' precisely '' , I replied .
'' Master , will you permit me to wish you a happy New Year ? ''
'' I should not , sir '' .
my head struck on a piece of iron , and with the violent shock I lost all consciousness .
'' ah , Commander ! your Nautilus is certainly a marvelous boat '' .
Conseil 's imperturbable coolness set me up again . I swam more vigorously ; but , cramped by my clothes , which stuck to me like a leaden weight , I felt great difficulty in bearing up . Conseil saw this .
at that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs were filling , and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the Atlantic .
'' speak , sir '' , I answered . '' I suppose this condition is one which a man of honor may accept ? ''
'' do they fish for them in these days ? '' asked Ned .
'' and you attribute this color to the presence of a microscopic seaweed ? ''
'' it will not take long '' , said the Canadian .
'' very slightly '' , I answered .
'' I agree with you '' , said I ; '' and steam seems to have killed all gratitude in the hearts of sailors . but , Captain , since you seem to have especially studied this sea , can you tell me the origin of its name ? ''
'' what time is it now ? '' asked the Canadian .
'' very well '' , replied Ned Land ; '' I accept the explanation , sir ; but , in our own interests , I regret that the opening of which you speak was not made above the level of the sea '' .
'' in the port ? '' said Ned , ironically .
'' behind the steersman 's cage is placed a powerful electric reflector , the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front '' .
'' and he rests now , near his companions , in the coral cemetery ? ''
'' I cannot tell , my friend '' .
'' have we struck anything ? '' I asked .
'' no '' , I said , '' poulps of huge dimensions '' .
'' keep your eyes open ! '' called out the sailors .
Ned Land 's logic pressed me hard , and I felt myself beaten on that ground . I knew not what argument would now tell in my favor .
'' perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw '' , said Conseil .
after crossing a rather large prairie , we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds .
early on the 1 st of January , 1863 , Conseil joined me on the platform .
'' and the Papuans ? ''
'' well '' , continued Captain Nemo , '' you heard my question ! do you know the history of Spain ? ''
'' to the Nautilus '' , said he .
'' because I have seen large whales , sir , whales measuring a hundred feet . I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick , of the Aleutian Islands , are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long '' .
'' we are blocked up then ? ''
